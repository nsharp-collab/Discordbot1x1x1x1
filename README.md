# Discordbot1x1x1x1
for my discord bot

if you want to use this bot in your own server make sure you replace the hardcoded channel and bot token, also make sure you have a functioning sql data base with these tabels (sql queries are provided in a file called "sql code")
the bot has basic moderation, support and leveling commands
